// include/strata/program/batch_read.hpp - how --batch reads a prompt in pieces (header-only: it is arithmetic).
//
// A prompt read with --batch stops between two pieces to (a) let the slots decode and (b) look for a BYIELD (a
// shorter request is waiting).  The pieces always end on a multiple of the prompt chunk, so they read exactly the
// chunks a single run would.

///   layer_split / piped: the read goes through a layer split's stages / the pipelined groups
///   chunks_per_piece: for a layer split with no slot decoding, the pieces' length in chunks (0: one run)

/// enough to keep the pipeline full, short enough that a BYIELD is taken within a few chunks (it used to wait for the
/// whole prompt, and the long prompt then held its slot: "ERR BGEN: no such free slot" for the request that should
